### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my code repo! I hope this is a space for me to build front-end technologies and strengthen my passions for back-end development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a full-stack application that can send, manipulate, and receive data from a server.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front-end development using React, GraphQL, Node.js, and Apollo.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning back-end development using C++ and SQL through [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Narnian12?hr_r=1).
