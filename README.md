### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my code repo! I hope this is a space for me to better appreciate front-end technologies and grow more in my passions for back-end development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a full-stack application that can send, manipulate, and receive data from a server.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, GraphQL, Node.js, and Apollo.
