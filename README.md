### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my code repo! I have been a member of GitHub for many years, but never really thought of populating it much. More recently, I have begun to appreciate learning new technologies a lot more.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a full-stack application that can send, manipulate, and receive data from a server.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, GraphQL, Node.js, and Apollo.
